## Purpose
Usually, people will waste hours to count the final scores of every classes and the final result sometimes will be changed by some naughty children since they are just written on the public blackboard.

The aim of this system is just to release these unnesssary jobs. The final score and ranking will be calculated and displayed automatially. Also, people can make sure that scores on it is definitely just and no one is capable to secretly alter the scores above.

### Philosophy
Put all the content in one page since there are not a lot of things to read for each single part or item. Use an extra page shown above(but still in the same webpage) will toggle the use of ajax so that more things will be required to load to realize more complicated actions and more content.
### Framework
Since I'm learning PYTHON in my school. Let's use django and I find it really awesome because the things used to be really complex in PHP are much easier here. As a result, I save a lot of time. Thanks to Django.
